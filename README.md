# ðŸ§  Emotion Classifier with LSTM (Journal Entry Mood Detection)

This project uses an LSTM neural network (built with Keras) to detect the **emotional tone** of journal-style entries.  
It predicts one of the following emotions:

> `joy`, `sadness`, `anger`, `fear`, `surprise`, `love`

## âœ… Results

- ðŸ“Š **Test Accuracy**: `89.25%`
- ðŸ§  Model: Single-layer LSTM with Embedding layer
- ðŸ“ˆ Early stopping by validation curve analysis
